DAVID OGILVY'S 10 COMMANDMENTS OF ADVERTISING
==============================================

David Ogilvy (1911-1999) was the "Father of Advertising" who founded Ogilvy & Mather and created iconic campaigns for Rolls-Royce, Dove, and others. His data-driven, consumer-focused approach revolutionized the industry.

## THE 10 COMMANDMENTS

### 1. WHAT YOU SAY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN HOW YOU SAY IT

"What you say in your advertising is more important than how you say it."

Key Points:
- Substance beats style every time
- A great idea poorly executed outperforms a mediocre idea brilliantly executed
- Focus on the message first, execution second
- Cleverness without a compelling proposition fails

Application:
Before worrying about design or copywriting technique, nail down your core message. What ONE thing do you want people to remember?

### 2. UNLESS YOUR CAMPAIGN IS BUILT ON A GREAT IDEA, IT WILL FAIL

"Unless your advertising contains a big idea, it will pass like a ship in the night."

Key Points:
- Big ideas are simple, unexpected, and compelling
- They can be summarized in one sentence
- They're memorable and ownable
- They provide a clear direction for all creative work

Examples of Big Ideas:
- Rolls-Royce: "At 60 miles an hour, the loudest noise comes from the electric clock"
- Dove: "Dove is one-quarter moisturizing cream"
- Hathaway Shirts: The man in the eye patch

### 3. GIVE THE FACTS

"The consumer is not a moron. She is your wife. Try not to insult her intelligence."

Key Points:
- Consumers want information, not empty claims
- The more you tell, the more you sell
- Specific facts are more believable than vague superlatives
- Long copy sells better than short copy for complex products

Application:
Include specific details:
- "Improved formula" → "Contains 25% more active ingredient"
- "Popular choice" → "Chosen by 127,000 customers last year"
- "Better performance" → "Lasts 3x longer than leading competitor"

### 4. YOU CANNOT BORE PEOPLE INTO BUYING

"You cannot bore people into buying your product. You can only interest them in buying it."

Key Points:
- Dull advertising is invisible advertising
- Interesting beats boring, even if less "professional"
- Tell stories, use humor, create intrigue
- Make people WANT to read/watch your ad

Warning: Interesting ≠ clever for its own sake. Interest must serve the selling proposition.

### 5. BE WELL-MANNERED BUT DON'T CLOWN

"The customer is not a moron. She is your wife. Don't insult her intelligence, and don't shock her just to get her attention."

Key Points:
- Respect your audience
- Avoid gimmicks that overshadow the message
- Don't try to be funny unless it serves the product
- Maintain dignity while being interesting

Bad Example: Funny ad that everyone remembers but no one can name the brand
Good Example: Interesting ad that makes the product the hero

### 6. MAKE YOUR ADVERTISING CONTEMPORARY

"Study the methods of your competitors and do the exact opposite."

Key Points:
- Don't imitate what's already working - you'll always be second
- Find white space in the market
- Be different in a meaningful way
- Modernize your approach as culture evolves

Application:
If competitors use fear, use aspiration
If they use celebrities, use real customers
If they focus on features, focus on lifestyle benefits

### 7. COMMITTEES CAN CRITICIZE, BUT ONLY INDIVIDUALS CAN CREATE

"Search all the parks in all your cities. You'll find no statues of committees."

Key Points:
- Great advertising requires individual vision
- Too many cooks dilute bold ideas
- Committees produce safe, mediocre work
- Give talented people freedom to create

For Business Owners:
Hire the best, give them a clear brief, then get out of their way.

### 8. IF IT DOESN'T SELL, IT ISN'T CREATIVE

"I do not regard advertising as entertainment or an art form, but as a medium of information. When I write an advertisement, I don't want you to tell me that you find it 'creative.' I want you to find it so interesting that you buy the product."

Key Points:
- Creativity is measured by results, not awards
- Beautiful ads that don't sell are failures
- Ugly ads that sell are successes
- Test everything against sales metrics

The Ogilvy Mantra:
"We sell or else."

### 9. NEVER WRITE AN ADVERTISEMENT YOU WOULDN'T WANT YOUR FAMILY TO READ

"Never do anything that would not make your Grandmother proud."

Key Points:
- Maintain ethical standards
- Build trust through honest advertising
- Short-term manipulation destroys long-term brand value
- Your reputation is your most valuable asset

Application:
- No deceptive pricing
- No exaggerated claims
- No hidden fees or fine print trickery
- No exploiting fears or insecurities dishonestly

### 10. BUILD YOUR BRAND'S TOTAL PERSONALITY

"The greater the similarity between products, the less part reason plays in brand selection. The manufacturer who dedicates his advertising to building the most sharply defined personality for his brand gets the largest share of the market."

Key Points:
- Brand personality > product features in commodity markets
- Consistency across all touchpoints builds recognition
- Every ad should contribute to a cohesive brand image
- Personality creates emotional connections

Examples:
- Apple: Innovative, rebellious, simple
- Volvo: Safe, reliable, Swedish
- Nike: Athletic, determined, inspiring

## OGILVY'S HEADLINE PRINCIPLES

Ogilvy obsessed over headlines because 80% of readers never get past them.

Rules for Headlines:
1. Include the brand name
2. Promise a benefit
3. Be specific (not vague)
4. Create curiosity
5. Test multiple versions

Famous Ogilvy Headlines:
- "At 60 miles an hour, the loudest noise in this new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock"
- "The man in the Hathaway shirt"
- "Pablo Picasso drank a quart of our rum every day"

## OGILVY ON RESEARCH

"Advertising people who ignore research are as dangerous as generals who ignore decodes of enemy signals."

Research Principles:
- Test before you launch
- Use split testing religiously
- Ask consumers what they want
- Watch what they DO, not just what they SAY
- Track every metric available

What to Research:
- Customer pain points
- Competitor positioning
- Message resonance
- Visual effectiveness
- Call-to-action performance

## OGILVY ON BUILDING BRANDS

"Every advertisement should contribute to the complex symbol which is the brand image."

Brand-Building Rules:
1. Consistency in every message
2. Quality over quantity
3. Position clearly vs. competition
4. Invest in the long term
5. Protect your reputation fiercely

Warning: Don't change strategies with every campaign. Build cumulative brand equity.

## OGILVY'S FORMULA FOR PERSUASIVE COPY

1. Get attention (headline)
2. Show benefit (subhead/opening)
3. Explain product (body copy)
4. Prove claims (testimonials, facts, guarantees)
5. Drive action (clear CTA)

## TIMELESS OGILVY QUOTES

"On average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy."

"The more informative your advertising, the more persuasive it will be."

"I do not regard advertising as entertainment or an art form, but as a medium of information."

"It pays to give most products an image of quality - a first-class ticket."

"Tell the truth, but make the truth fascinating."

"Good products can be sold by honest advertising. If you don't think the product is good, you have no business to be advertising it."

"In the modern world of business, it is useless to be a creative, original thinker unless you can also sell what you create."

## THE OGILVY LEGACY

"If it doesn't sell, it isn't creative."

This single principle separates Ogilvy from award-chasing creatives. Results matter more than recognition.
