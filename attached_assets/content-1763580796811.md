## "With God’s help we will do mighty things."

Psalms 60:12

## Why am I running?

Every Arizona sunrise reminds us why we fight for this home we love. The desert, the mountains, and the people here tell a story of **faith, hard work, and hope**. The same spirit that built the American Dream.

Together, we can restore it by putting **faith, family, and freedom** back at the heart of American life.

But too many families today feel that dream slipping away. It’s time to restore it by putting **faith, family, and freedom** back at the heart of American life.

I’m running for Congress to serve the people who make Arizona strong - parents raising their kids with grit and grace, small-business owners who never give up, and communities held together by prayer and purpose.

**Together, we can renew hope, strengthen families, and build a future worthy of our children.**

This is our Arizona. Let’s keep her strong, free, and full of promise.

Join the Mission. Restore the Dream.

Not a career politician — a husband, father of four, follower of Jesus, and businessman.

I’ve spent years helping people rebuild their lives and reach their potential.

I believe government should serve families, not the other way around.

Restoring the American Dream is more than words — it’s what drives me every day.
